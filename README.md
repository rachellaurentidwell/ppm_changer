# ppm_changer
This program, when run, will ask the user for an input file. I have two input files in this file system (bunny.ppm and cake.ppm) 
Then, it will ask the user what they want the output file name to be. This can be anything you want. The program will then give a 
list of different effects to apply to your ppm file. You select the one you want by typing the number associated with it, and then
it will make the changes. You can view the changed picture by visiting any ppm viewing site.
